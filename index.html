        <li><h3> How It Works:</h3></li><br/><br/>
        <li id="tool-text"> <b>Opportunity</b>: Blender's "Cell Fracture" object fracture tool doesn't work well on abnormal meshes like the chess pieces but I needed it to work for my destruction effects.
        </li><br/><br/>
        <li id="tool-text"> <b>Solution</b>: There is an add-on (plugin for you maya users) called Cell Fracture in Blender. What this does is take in meshes, breaks some edges and then fills in holes in the new meshes. The issue with this add-on I had was that it does not work well at all with meshes that have long extrusions or odd loops like character meshes. I solved this by:
        </li> <br/><br/>
        <li id="tool-text"> 1. Creating a script that first breaks my character meshes by their respective vert-groups. This makes it so hands, feet, weapons and everything else is broken into its own mesh.
        </li>    <br/>
        <li id="tool-text"> 2. Fill the holes in these meshes.
        </li>     <br/>
        <li id="tool-text"> 3. Call cell fracture on those meshes.
        </li> <br/><br/>
        <li id="tool-text"> <b>Result</b>: Wasn't perfect, but reduced manual work from about half a work day to break a character to about 1-2 hours per character. This was a huge a time saver, but was also more of a work-around than a proper solution. Nowadays I would much rather use something like Houdini's destruction system for more realistic breaks.

      <li><h3> How It Works:</h3>
      </li><br/><br/>

      <li id="tool-text"> <b>Opportunity</b>:&nbsp A huge amount of time would be spent manually baking each level of the game within Unreal Engine after minor level changes and when new levels are made.
      </li><br/><br/>

      <li id="tool-text"> <b>Solution</b>: &nbsp I made this tool to have Unreal bake lighting for all levels at the end of each day so we could package and QA immediately the next day.

                          <br/>&nbsp<br/> Unreal Engine has a set of ".ini" files that let developers easily setup graphics and device settings. By default you'll see 3-4 files in the Config folder of your EU project,
                                          one of which is DefaultGame.ini. This file contains all the maps you include in your game along with a ton of settings you can set manually within UE.
                          <br/>&nbsp<br/>
                          <br/>&nbsp<br/>What to do:
                          <br/><br/> 1. Do this now: click-clack your way to your game's .uproject, then open the Output Log, and click the Build button above your viewport to bake your lightmap for any level.
                          <br/><br/> 2. In the Output log you'll see a log that looks a hell of a lot like the commands in the links below. That line of code tells UE exactly how to bake your lightmaps do based on your
                                            settings for that level.
                          <br/><br/> 3. Run this line for every map in a python script with your editor closed.
                          <br/>&nbsp<br/>
                          <br/>&nbsp<br/> Things to note:
                          <br/><br/> 1. Make sure you've got set Python 2.7x in your PATH. It lets you run Python from your console/terminal.
                          <br/><br/> 2. On macs, we also need change the .py suffix on the filename to .command. This lets Macs use the file as a standalone program
                          <br/><br/> 3. Make sure your file permissions are set to allow python to interact with the relevant filese
        </li><br/><br/>

        <li id="tool-text"> <b>Result:</b> &nbsp Sick. The alternatives of baking 30-50 levels(at ~5-10 minutes per level) or baking only a few levels for testing is unfeasible and significantly less useful respectively. Faster iteration!
                                          Seriously, this couldn't be simpler and I'm less than scratching the surface of Unreal's automation setup with this writeup so please go check it out for yourself!
                                          I wish we could have this in Unity too, I'll do another writeup if I ever need to do the same in Unity!

       <li><h3> How It Works:</h3>
       </li><br/><br/>

       <li id="tool-text"> <b>Opportunity</b>:&nbsp Same as the auto lightmap baking tool, a huge amount of time would be spent packaging the game for many devices for QA and testing.
       </li><br/><br/>

       <li id="tool-text"> <b>Solution</b>: &nbsp I made this tool to let us package the game for different devices so we don't have to open Unreal and have one of us devoted to pressing the "package game" button over and over.
                          <br/>&nbsp<br/>

                          <br/>&nbsp<br/>What to do:
                          <br/><br/> 1. Same as above, I used the UAT to power this tool but this time I decided to decouple a little further and let the user specify the RunUAT filepath just in case we needed Windows builds in the future. You can find the RunUAT that works on your OS in your install folder [Epic Games/UE/Engine/Build/BatchFiles].
                          <br/><br/> 2. Just like above, use the Message Log to find the line used to package the game and split that into the filepaths and commands. I also let the user specify which type of packaging they want: Development or Shipping. The key differences being in the Shipping builds you wont get access to Editor console commands and your won't be able to profile your game since UE will strip the game of your method names when packaging. Which is great since you can do any profiling work you need with Development builds and then not worry about someone decompiling your game easily with the Shipping build.

                          <br/>&nbsp<br/>
                          <br/>&nbsp<br/> Things to note:
                          <br/><br/> 1. One important thing to note is that if you're an iOS developer, you have to set your development and shipping certificates. These are saved as pure strings and you can find them (once you've attached them to Unreal) within the Project Settings in UE.
                          <br/><br/> 2. When making builds you have to set these certificates, whether for development or shipping for iOS and tvOS, manually. However, I believe you can save these strings within your script and set them inside DefaultGame.ini. I actually didn't get to that point since we didn't end up using this tool all that much. In any case, you can automate your iOS and tvOS (and iPadOS now) builds like this as well. </li>
        </li><br/><br/>

        <li id="tool-text"> <b>Result:</b> &nbsp Mixed. We did not find the tool significantly useful in practice for this project, though I am sure it would be extremely useful for studios with a dedicated QA team or a game available on more platforms. Automated packaging for all platforms overnight, ready to then test the next morning!

       </li>

       <li id="tool-text"> Playing a game of chess to view each animation is not efficient for iterative improvements.
       </li><br/><br/>

       <li id="tool-text"> <b>Solution</b>:
       </li>

       <li id="tool-text"> I made a Unity scene that let me look at models and animations quickly in the editor. Doubles as a bonus "level" in Wizards Chess VR.
       <br/>&nbsp<br/>For this, I used Unity's Editor API to create some simple buttons in the inspector to instantiate each character and play back inidividual animations.
        </li><br/><br/>

       <li id="tool-text"> <b>Result:</b>
       </li>

       <li id="tool-text"><br/>Dope. Hard to say how much time this saved me, but I couldn't have the animations work properly in game without it. Previewing animations in-engine is necessary, playing a game of chess every time I want to preview is not.
       </li><br/><br/>

       <li id="tool-text"> It is a bit less user-friendly than I think would be good for a production tool with multiple people, but since it was just me I didn't think spending time on creating a standalone tool would be much use.

     </li>

     <li id="tool-text"> Scripts to mirror position, vertex weights, and bone constraints from the left side to the right for symmetric models.
     </li><br/><br/>

     <li id="tool-text"> Blender provides tools for things like mirroring bones over an axis and even renaming them for you. But what I wanted was to mirror all left facing bones to the right side while also mirroring bone weights and names with the click of a button.
     </li><br/><br/>
     <li id="tool-text"> This does exactly that by grabbing all left bones (through naming scheme), mirroring each bone, their weights, and vertex groups.
     </li><br/><br/>
     <li id="tool-text"> Works without any issues on symmetrical rigs and even in some cases on asymmetrical rigs in which I needed many of the same bones but not all.

    <li id="tool-text"> <b>Result:</b>
