             <li><h3> How It Works:</h3></li>
              <li id="tool-text"> This was a fun one. There is an add-on (plugin for you maya users) called Cell Fracture in Blender. What this does is take in meshes, breaks some edges and then fills in holes in the new meshes. The issue with this add-on I had was that it does not work well at all with meshes that have long extrusions or odd loops like character meshes. I solved this by:
              </li> <br/><br/>
              <li id="tool-text"> 1. Creating a script that first breaks my character meshes by their respective vert-groups. This makes it so hands, feet, weapons and everything else is broken into its own mesh.
              </li>    <br/>
              <li id="tool-text"> 2. Fill the holes in these meshes.
              </li>     <br/>
              <li id="tool-text"> 3. Call cell fracture on those meshes.
              </li> <br/><br/>
              <li id="tool-text"> This was a huge a time saver, but was also more of a work-around than a proper solution. Nowadays I would much rather use something like Houdini's destruction system for more realistic breaks.

          <ul class="flex-contrainer3 tool-description">

            <li><h3> How It Works:</h3></li>
            <li id="tool-text">Unreal Engine has an awesome set of ".ini" files that let developers easily setup graphics and device settings (And probably more, I haven't touched all of it). These are found in your UE install folder [Epic Games/UE/Engine/Config] with the filenames all starting with "Base". Now, you can change these base .ini's if you want but I recommend not doing that as those changes will affect all your UE projects.</li>
            <br/><br/>
            <li id="tool-text">What you should do is take a look at your project file itself. That will contain another Config folder in which you'll find some of the same .ini's you found in your install folder but these won't have the "Base" filename prefix. These files affect only the project that contains them so editing these isn't a problem. By default you'll see 3-4 files in there, one of which is DefaultGame.ini. This file contains all the maps you include in your game along with a ton of settings you can set manually within UE. What I wanted to do was take the maplist available within the .ini and use that to generate lightmaps for all our maps. That sounds much more complicated than it is thanks to Unreal's built-in Automation tools. One of these tools, called the Unreal Automation Tool (UAT) lets you run Unreal console commands within the terminal (MacOS/Linux) and the console (Windows). </li>
            <br/><br/>
            <li id="tool-text">Official documentation: &nbsp <a href="https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/Programming/BuildTools/AutomationTool/Overview/index.html"> Link </a> &nbsp I did not know proper documentation existed until I started writing but here's a link to some old documentation that I used to get a great start: &nbsp<a href="https://wiki.unrealengine.com/How_to_package_your_game_with_commands">UE Wiki</a> &nbsp </li>
            <br/><br/>
            <li id="tool-text">Now lets get to the point of this tool. What I did was cheat. Do this now: click-clack your way to your game's .uproject, then open the Output Log, and the Build button above your viewport to bake your lightmap for your level. In the Output log you'll see a line that looks a hell of a lot like the commands in the links above. That line tells UE exactly what to do based on your settings. All I did was create a fresh python file, assigned this string to a variable, and let it run. Of course, that didn't work because why would it? Make sure you've got set Python 2.7x in your PATH. I'm still slightly too lazy to know exactly what that means but essentially it lets you run Python from your console/terminal. This is important because we need to do this for the UE4 script. We also need change the .py suffix on the filename to .command. This lets Macs use the file as a standalone proggram. </li>
            <br/><br/>
            <li id="tool-text"> There is a way on Mac/Linux to skip this, which is what I did actually, but it isn't hard to understand so here's a couple links to get you there:&nbsp <a href="https://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/finding-bash-perl-python-portably-using-env.html"> Link 1</a> &nbsp &nbsp <a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/29608/why-is-it-better-to-use-usr-bin-env-name-instead-of-path-to-name-as-my"> Link to warnings about this method </a> </li>
            <li id="tool-text"> After that all I did was break up the line I got from the Message Log in UE4 into the .uproject's filepath, the UAT filepath, and the commands. Then I ask for user input to find the .uproject path and DefaultGame.ini filepath (to not hard-couple the tool to our project and just one computer), store the maplist in a list, and successively tell UE4 to generate the lightmap for each map (it's just a for-loop). </li>
            <br/><br/>
            <li id="tool-text"> Seriously, this couldn't be simpler and I'm less than scratching the surface of Unreal's awesome automation setup with this writeup so please go check it out for yourself! I wish we could have this in Unity too, I'll do another writeup if I ever need to do the same in Unity!</li>

             <p class="card-text"> Opportunity: Same as the auto lightmass baking tool, a huge amount of time would be spent packaging the game for many devices for QA and testing. </p>
             <p class="card-text"> Solution: I made this tool to let us package the game for different devices so we don't have to open Unreal and have one of us devoted to pressing the "package game" button over and over. </p>
             <p class="card-text"> Result: Failure. We did not find the tool significantly useful in practice for this project, though I am sure it would be extremely useful for studios with a dedicated QA team or a game available on more platforms. Automated packaging for all platforms overnight, ready to then test the next morning! </p>

             <li><h3> How It Works:</h3></li>
             <li id="tool-text"> Same as above, I used the UAT to power this tool. This time I decided to decouple a little further and let the user specify the RunUAT filepath just in case we needed Windows builds in the future. You can find the RunUAT that works on your OS in your install folder [Epic Games/UE/Engine/Build/BatchFiles]. Again, same as above, I used the Message Log to find the line used to package the game and split that into the filepaths and commands. I also let the user specify which type of packaging they want: Development or Shipping. The key differences being in the Shipping builds you wont get access to Editor console commands and your won't be able to profile your game since UE will strip the game of your method names when packaging. Which is great since you can do any profiling work you need with Development builds and then not worry about someone decompiling your game easily with the Shipping build.</li>
             <br/><br/>
             <li id="tool-text"> One important thing to note is that if you're an iOS developer, you have to set your development and shipping certificates. These are saved as pure strings and you can find them (once you've attached them to Unreal) within the Project Settings in UE. When making builds you have to set these certificates, whether for development or shipping for iOS and tvOS, manually. However, you can save these strings within your script and set them inside DefaultGame.ini. I actually didn't get to that point since we didn't end up using this tool all that much. In any case, you can automate your iOS and tvOS (and iPadOS now) builds like this as well. </li>
